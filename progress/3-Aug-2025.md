Notes / Reflections

    -> Revise BT&BST+LL+Stack&Queue fully, Arrays uptil covered, Graphs uptil covered
    -> MK assignment finish the Pending portions

    -> Close the Graphs section today
    
    ->start from remaining arrays

Pending ;(

    Finish MK Assignment
    Pending
            ->Iterative implementation of QuickSort
                1.With tail recursion
                2.Both recursions iteratively

    Finish Arrays portion completely
