Topic Studied

    Revised 1 Graph questions
    Did revision of all graph algorithms except Kruskals
    Revised the Iterative implementation of Pre,Inorder,Postorder(2 types- 1 stack and 2 stack) variations
    Studied Pandas from W3 Schools

Notes / Reflections

    Met Sir today - (Quick Sort Iterative implementation...can be done very easily if pre,in,post iterative versions have been done... + Kosarajus...Read from CLRS+Algorithms by DasGupta + bfs,dfs problems and implementation) -> (Prims,Kruskals,Dijkstras)
    
    Revise DSU and Kruskals Algorithm tomorrow
    Revise the 6 bfs+dfs pblms pending in the upcoming weekend at home (Be obsessed)

    Move onto Graphs-Part 2 after that
